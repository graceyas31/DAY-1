                                                              OBJECTS IN JS

#Objects is the important data type in modern js.
#Ojects are quite different from (numbers,boolean,string).
#An object is a refernce data type
#Object are enclosed in open and closed pranthesis and have both keys and values.
#In javascript,an object is a standalone entity,with properties and type.
#In simple terms "a javscript object is a collection of named values and behaviour(properties and method).
#EXAMPLES- car,pen,phone,fridge(real time examples).
#All the cars have same properties,but the property values differ from car to car.
#the following code represents the simple "OBJECT"

     Var car = { name : "MORRIS GARRAGE" };

#Object has both keys and values.
#Ojects are variable too,it can contain many values.keys and values are seperated by :(colan).
#More prperties are occur in Oject.For example car has a property like color,weight,mileage,fueltype etc.
#So, conclusion and simpe definition or javascript objects method is " methods are actions that can be performed on objects".
